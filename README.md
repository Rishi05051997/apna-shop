# APNA SHOP

APNA SHOP is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the html css & Js stack. 
<!-- The application loads 
products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can 
click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and 
add them to their shopping cart -->

<!-- ## Import Data
I have included a data folder in this repo. Inside that folder will be 2 folders called cart and item. These 2 folders contain a mongodump of the 2 collections that I use in this ecommerce demo. You can use the [import-data.sh](data/import-data.sh) script to import these 2 dumps to an ecommerce database, then you will have the same content that I have for this demo. -->
